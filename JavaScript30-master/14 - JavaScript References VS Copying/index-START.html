    // however what happens when we update that array?
    console.log(players,playerssss);

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team = players.slice();
    team[3] = "NNNNNN"
    console.log(players,team);
    // one way
    
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team33 = [].concat(players);
    team33[2] = ""
    console.log(players,team33);
    
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const correctPlayer = [...players];
    correctPlayer[0] = "PPPPPPPPP"
    console.log(players,correctPlayer);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap222222 = Object.assign({}, person,{number:99, age:12});
    console.log(cap222222);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
